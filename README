Project : CH341A relay board
Using just plain linux and libusb-1.0 control the relays

Building the software:
- have gcc/make etc installed
- run make
- done

Connect the board using a usb cable.
Make sure you have enough rights to control the USB device (see if it is present with lsusb command)
Bus 002 Device 024: ID 1a86:5512 Unknown 

If you need to run the board as a normal user you need to a a rule to udev to allow it
My group was 'oetelaar' make sure you set up your group correctly, not my group name!! 

$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/60-OETEL-IOSOLUTION-ABACOM.rules 
ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="isp_rules_end"
SUBSYSTEM!="usb", GOTO="isp_rules_end"
ENV{DEVTYPE}!="usb_device", GOTO="isp_rules_end"

# de IOsolution USB board
# Bus 002 Device 006: ID 07a0:1008
# no longer sold
ATTR{idVendor}=="07a0", ATTR{idProduct}=="1008", MODE="660", GROUP="oetelaar"

# new device, ABACOM relay board based on CH341A chip in MEM mode
ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="5512", MODE="660", GROUP="oetelaar"

LABEL="isp_rules_end"
# end of file

Usage Examples: 
# run as root if you do not have udev set up correctly
sudo ./switch_relay 1 2

# verbose logging (and as normal user)
./switch_relay -v 1 8

Pro: not expensive, ships in couple of days.

Cons: 
- small relays, 
- no LED when board has power 
- or when Relay actived, 
- no way to see what is happening
- The software is old windows DLL only, 
- no documentation on how it works, no schematic.
- no way to read the actual state of the registers on the board

Use google translate to read it, it is in Chinese.

The relay board works in MEM mode of the chip.
The data is shifted into the register bit by bit, clock by clock using a (too) complex USB protocol
The data is moved into a shift register which looks like this
a uPD6345 from NEC
I found a datasheet here.

In theory multiple shift registers could be cascoded to form a very long register with many outputs.

Hope this helps someone, 
If something is wrong or missing, sorry no garanties by me, I am just a guy sharing his findings.

PS. be careful, make sure failure of the software or board can not result in harm to anyone!!
